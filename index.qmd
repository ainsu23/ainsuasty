**Hola \| Hi \| Cześć**
:::

Please receive a warm welcome to my website. You will find three main sections:

-   **DataLab**: Explore a variety of resources I've compiled from my experience, including `blogs` on programming (R, Python, SQL, Spark, PowerBI), my own `Shiny` apps, `Data Science projects` and `operations research` where I apply OR techniques using tools like R and Python.

-   **Personal Projects and More**: Visit my "Torito & Misiu" Facebook page for inspirational quotes. Also find more about my personal life, family, travels, and hobbies.

-   **Recommended Books**: Discover books I've read along with key lessons and their application in my daily life.
